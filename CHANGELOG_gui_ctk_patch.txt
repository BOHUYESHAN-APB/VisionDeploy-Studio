Patch summary - app/gui_ctk.py changes

1) Fixed _on_reload_fonts thread startup
   - Ensured worker thread is started outside of exception handling to avoid missing thread start.
   - Kept best-effort rebind_default_font calls.

2) Repaired _on_prepare_env early-return and reinserted open_dialog
   - When OnDemandEnvironmentManager is missing, now early-return and set a status message.
   - Reinserted a robust open_dialog implementation that wires to start_prepare, request_cancel and export_log.

3) Completed refresh_model_list fallback and device population
   - Implemented hardware_detector lookup (get_device_summary / get_summary) with defensive fallbacks.
   - Translate GPU entries to readable labels and populate CTk/tk device menus.
   - Keep previous device selection when possible; otherwise set sensible default.

4) Completed static fallback branch for refresh_model_list
   - Populate simple static item list if main path fails.

5) Ran file-level static checks (no errors reported by static analyzer used in workspace).

Notes:
- These are local edits to app/gui_ctk.py to make CTk frontend more robust and import-safe.
- Please run local functional test: python temp/test_import_gui_ctk.py or start the app to validate runtime behavior on your machine.
