Files modified:

- .gitignore — added `temp/TeMP/` to ignore developer archives
- README.md — added pointer to `DOCS/` index

Notes / next actions:

- The `temp/TeMP/` directory is intentionally ignored by Git. These are developer-only archives.
- `scripts/` contains safe copies for convenience; do not change runtime imports to point to `scripts/` copies.
- Please confirm whether you want the original root files removed or retained; recommended: retain originals to avoid breaking existing workflows.

To validate locally:

1. Open `DOCS/INDEX.md` to review centralized docs.
2. Run the import test: python temp/test_import_gui_ctk.py
